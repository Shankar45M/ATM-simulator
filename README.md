# ATM-simulator
Objective:
Design a Python program to simulate a basic ATM machine. The program will allow users to 
perform transactions such as checking the balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money. 
The program will utilize for and while loops, along with break and continue statements, to 
control the transaction flow.
## Scenario:
You are tasked with programming a simple ATM machine. The ATM will allow the user to:
1. Check their account balance.
2. Withdraw money from their account.
3. Deposit money into their account.
4. Exit the ATM system.
## The ATM will:
1. Start with an initial balance of $500.
2. Allow the user to select an option from a menu of available actions.
3. Process the user's selection and execute the corresponding transaction.
4. Repeat the process until the user decides to exit the ATM by selecting the appropriate 
option.
